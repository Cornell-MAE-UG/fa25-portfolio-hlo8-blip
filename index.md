## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a strong focus on aerospace systems and energy-driven propulsion. I am particularly interested in propulsion technologies spanning both renewable energy systems and traditional fossil-fuel–based engines. Through coursework, lab work, and design projects, I have developed a hands-on, analytical approach to engineering problems and a strong interest in applying theory to practical aerospace systems.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
